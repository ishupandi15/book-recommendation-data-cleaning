- Built a recommender system that recommends books based on user ratings.
- Converted raw rating data into a user–book sparse matrix.
- Exported dataset to `.libsvm` format for efficient ML model use.
- Used Python libraries: Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn.
- Output file: `ratings3-2.libsvm`
- Report document: `Project_Step1-2.docx`
