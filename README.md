### 🏫 **Arizona State University — IFT 520: Analyzing Big Data**
**Instructor:** Dr. Asmaa Elbadrawy  

---

## 🚀 Overview
A two-phase academic project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and modeling large-scale book rating data.  
The goal was to build a **personalized recommendation engine**, discover **user behavior clusters**, and **predict missing demographic data** using machine-learning models.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Methods

- **Languages:** Python 3.10+
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn
- **Data Handling:** Sparse Matrices, Data Cleaning, Feature Mapping
- **Modeling:** User–User Collaborative Filtering, Cosine Similarity
- **Clustering:** KMeans, Agglomerative (Ward), DBSCAN
- **Regression:** Linear, Polynomial, Decision Tree, K-Fold CV
- **Outputs:** CSV, libsvm, Text Reports


---

## 🧱 Phase 1 – Data Preparation
- Processed raw book-ratings data into a sparse matrix (User × Book).  
- Exported dataset into **.libsvm** format for machine-learning pipelines.  
- Implemented with Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.  
**Output:** `ratings3-2.libsvm`  

---

## 📊 Phase 2 – Data Analysis & Modeling

### 🔹 Task 1 – Collaborative Filtering
- Built a **User–User Recommender** using cosine similarity (K = 10).  
- Generated top-5 unread book recommendations per user.  
**Output:** `Book_Recommendations1.csv`

### 🔹 Task 2 – Discovering User Groups
- Clustered users with **KMeans**, **Agglomerative (Ward)**, and **DBSCAN**.  
- Analyzed most-frequent books per cluster to interpret reading trends.  
**Output:** `clusters_top_books_k10.txt`

### 🔹 Task 3 – Predicting User Ages
- Trained **Linear**, **Polynomial**, and **Decision Tree** regressors with 5-fold CV.  
- Selected model with lowest RMSE and predicted ages for users missing demographic info.  
**Output:** `User_Age_Predictions.csv`

---

## 📈 Results Summary

- **`ratings3-2.libsvm`** → Clean, sparse matrix of user–book ratings  
- **`Book_Recommendations1.csv`** → Personalized top-5 book recommendations  
- **`clusters_top_books_k10.txt`** → Top-10 most popular books per user cluster  
- **`User_Age_Predictions.csv`** → Estimated ages for users with missing demographic data

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline from preprocessing → modeling → evaluation.  
- Applied collaborative filtering and clustering for user-behavior analysis.  
- Used regression and cross-validation for demographic prediction.  
- Gained experience in reproducible data-science documentation and GitHub collaboration.
